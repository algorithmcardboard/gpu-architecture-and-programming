\section{List of optimizations}
\subsection{First GPU version}
Implemented with a kernel that takes the array and a prime number as arguments.  The kernel calculates its id and checks if its id is a perfect multiple of the prime number and also checks if it is not equal to the prime number.  If this condition matches, it sets the array to 1 and exits.

\textbf{Time for 10M}: Too long to wait (more than 30 minutes).  Killed the process.

\subsection{Second GPU version}

This version takes multiple prime numbers as inputs and does the same processing.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When 8 primes are considered; Time = 5m, 20s
    \item When 128 primes are considered; Time = 1m, 32s
    \item When 1024 primes are considered; Time = 41.375 seconds
    \item When 2048 primes are considered; Time =  40 seconds
\end{enumerate}

While doing this testing, I also checked the code for branch divergence and other events that happens in the GPU\@.  From the summary output of nvcc, we can find that the majority of the time is spent in \textit{cudamemcopy}.
I tried to remove this by creating a <<<1,1>>> kernel that again creates multiple kernels for prime number processing.  
But this failed as I cannot compile this for the current cuda device I have.

\subsection{Reducing Branch Divergence}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I tried reducing branch divergence by combining all exit cases into a single case.  This helped improved the performance by around 4 seconds.
    \item I also added conditions to check if a thread is processing a number which is already a non-prime.  This didn't improve the performance much.
    \item I added change to exit out of the for loop as soon as the number is found to be non-prime.  This helped in saving around 3 seconds.
\end{enumerate}
